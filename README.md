# Bakool: Shopping Basket Library

A flexible Ruby library for managing shopping baskets with support for products, delivery charges, and discount rules.

## Features

- ðŸ›’ **Shopping Basket Management**: Add products to a basket and calculate totals
- ðŸ“¦ **Product Catalogue**: Manage product inventory with codes, names, and prices
- ðŸšš **Flexible Delivery Charges**: Configurable delivery charge rules based on order total
- ðŸŽ¯ **Discount Rules**: Customizable discount calculations for promotional offers
- ðŸ§ª **Test Coverage**: Comprehensive test suite with RSpec
- ðŸ”§ **Extensible Design**: Easy to extend with custom rules and behaviors


## Assumptions made for development:

- We're dealing with an unspecified currency that uses 2 decimal places for cents
- We currently will only support having one discount rule and one delivery charge rule per basket
- Delivery calculations are only done based on the total price after discount and is not dependent on what items are in the basket
- Discount calculations depends on the items/item combinations in the basket


## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone <repository-url>
cd bakool
```

2. Install dependencies:

bundle install
```

## Usage

### Basic Usage

```ruby
require_relative 'lib/basket'

# Create a basket with default catalogue and rules
basket = Basket.new

# Add products by their codes
basket.add("R01")  # Red Widget
basket.add("G01")  # Green Widget
basket.add("B01")  # Blue Widget

# Calculate total (includes delivery charges and discounts)
total = basket.total
puts "Total: $#{total}"
```

### Default Products

The library comes with a default catalogue containing:

| Code | Name | Price |
|------|------|-------|
| R01  | Red Widget | $32.95 |
| G01  | Green Widget | $24.95 |
| B01  | Blue Widget | $7.95 |

### Custom Delivery Charges

```ruby
# Create custom delivery charge rule
delivery_rule = DeliveryChargeRule.new(lambda do |order_total|
  if order_total < 5000 then 495      # $4.95 for orders under $50
  elsif order_total < 9000 then 295   # $2.95 for orders under $90
  else 0                              # Free delivery for orders $90+
  end
end)

basket = Basket.new(delivery_charge_rule: delivery_rule)
```

### Custom Discount Rules

```ruby
# Create discount rule for "buy one get one half price" on Red Widgets
discount_rule = DiscountRule.new(lambda do |basket|
  red_widgets = basket.items.filter { |item| item.code == "R01" }
  if red_widgets.count >= 2
    # Apply 50% discount to second Red Widget
    (red_widgets.first.price_in_cents / 2.0).ceil
  else
    0
  end
end)

basket = Basket.new(discount_rule: discount_rule)
```

### Complete Example

```ruby
# Create basket with custom rules
delivery_rule = DeliveryChargeRule.new(lambda do |order_total|
  if order_total < 5000 then 495
  elsif order_total < 9000 then 295
  else 0
  end
end)

discount_rule = DiscountRule.new(lambda do |basket|
  red_widgets = basket.items.filter { |item| item.code == "R01" }
  if red_widgets.count >= 2
    (red_widgets.first.price_in_cents / 2.0).ceil
  else
    0
  end
end)

basket = Basket.new(
  delivery_charge_rule: delivery_rule,
  discount_rule: discount_rule
)

# Add items
basket.add("R01")  # Red Widget
basket.add("R01")  # Second Red Widget (50% off)
basket.add("G01")  # Green Widget

# Calculate total
total = basket.total
puts "Total: $#{total}"  # Output: Total: $54.37
```
